# Get Into It! — Mobile Game

**Get Into It!** is a 3D mobile game that I developed at the age of 17 and successfully published on the Google Play Store.

## Gameplay Overview
The player controls a cube that can move left and right and jump. The objective is to jump through openings in moving walls — touching the walls results in instant death. The game provides audio feedback on jumps and allows the player to purchase cosmetic skins.

### Game Modes
- **Level Mode** — 30 handcrafted levels with progressive difficulty. Completing levels rewards the player with points that can be spent on skins (different cube shades).

## Development & Assets
- Built with **Unity**
- 3D models, UI, and animations created in **Blender**
- Progress saved using **PlayerPrefs**
- Published on the **Google Play Store**
- Integrated **Google Play Ads** for monetization

## Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Unity
- **Language:** C#
- **3D Modeling:** Blender
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Data Storage:** PlayerPrefs
- **Platform:** Android (Google Play)
- **Plugins:** Google Mobile Ads SDK

## What I Learned
- Full Unity production pipeline from prototype to release
- Importing 3D assets and handling materials
- Scene transitions and maintaining state between scenes
- Player progression & data persistence
- Game design (level pacing, difficulty curves)
- Mobile monetization through advertisements
- Publishing through Google Play Console (store listing, screenshots, descriptions, contracts)

## Notes
This was one of my early mobile projects and helped me understand both technical and production aspects of game development beyond simple prototypes.
